- Provider urls are now automagically been changed to include the correct sort order for search results

Note: It has been an point of confusion since the very beginning of Fredy, that people simply copied the url, but
did not take care of sorting the search results by date. If this is not done, Fredy will most likely not see the latest
results, thus cannot report them. This release fixes it by adding the necessary params (or replaces them).
